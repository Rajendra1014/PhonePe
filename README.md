Digitization of India - Visulization Through PhonePe

**Project Title**	Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly
**Technologies	**Github Cloning, Python, Pandas, MySQL, mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.
**Domain	** Fintech


Problem Statement: The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
The data offered by PhonePe will be relevant for multiple stakeholders including government, policy makers, regulatory bodies, media, industry analysts, merchant partners, startups, academic institutions and students. The data as well as the trends could be used by multiple entities to understand consumer and merchant behavior and identify new opportunities for growth.

Approach: 1. Data extraction: Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON. 2. Data transformation: Use a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization. 3. Database insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands
